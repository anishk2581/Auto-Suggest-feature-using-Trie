# Auto-suggest-feature-using-trie

Trie is a tree-based data structure which is used for efficient retrieval of a key in a large data-set of strings. Main advantage of trie is searching a key . This can be done be in O( length_of_key ) which is very fast in compare to naive search where we check for every word in our collections that it matches with key.  Now consider a scenario where a user is typing and in mid way all suggestion( words which user actually wants to type ) just pops up . This feature can be implements with the help of trie.

All utility function (like searching ,insertion , deletion , auto_suggest ) are implemented in C++.
